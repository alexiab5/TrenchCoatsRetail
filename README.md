This GUI application built using C++ and the Qt framework simulates managing an online trench coat store providing two modes: Administrator and User. Administrators can update the database, while users can browse and purchase trench coats. The Observer Pattern ensures real-time updates, reflecting changes made by admins directly in the user interface.
